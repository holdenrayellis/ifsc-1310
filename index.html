    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <section><p>Progressive enhancement seems like an effective approach to web design. It allows for a sort of base functionality in the HTML, layering other enhancements on top. Designing in this way allows the website to still be functional if something fails. Perhaps the website would be less appealing, but still functional if there are errors within the javascript or css. I like this approach because it includes a wider range of users, such as people who are still using old browsers. An example would be for a website that sells products, and its goal is to get people to buy. If a user loads this website on some strange or old browser, they could still buy something instead of getting a 404 or some other error.
 
      Here's an interesting articled I found by Joel Adewole that gives some practical examples of progressive enhancement : <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement">https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement</a>.</p></section>
