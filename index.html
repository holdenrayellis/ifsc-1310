    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <section><p>Progressive enhancement seems like an effective approach to web design. It allows for a sort of base functionality in the HTML, layering other enhancements on top. Designing in this way allows the website to still be functional if something fails. Perhaps the website would be less appealing, but still functional if there are errors within the javascript or css. I like this approach because it includes a wider range of users, such as people who are still using old browsers. An example would be for a website that sells products, and its goal is to get people to buy. If a user loads this website on some strange or old browser, they could still buy something instead of getting a 404 or some other error.
      Here's an interesting articled I found by Joel Adewole that gives some practical examples of progressive enhancement : <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement">https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement</a>.</p></section>
    <h1>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h1>
    <section>For my Dragon Project, the main revision was the contact and faq pages. The contact page didn’t have any kind of form, as mentioned by my peer, and the faq page didn’t have any faqs. So I added some faqs to the faq page using the h2 and section elements. For the contact page I needed to add a form, so I added some inputs and labels, even though it doesn’t really contact anyone, the form is there. I also added a submit button that highlights when the cursor goes over it.
        Throughout this semester I have learned how to use many useful tools such as corel vector, gitpod, github, etc. I found the bear on the moon assignment interesting, being able to manipulate/photoshop an image to give the illusion of something. Also I learned many useful image manipulation tools such as the mask tool. I’ve also noticed how powerful Corel Vector is for an online application, and will most likely use it on my future endeavors. Obviously there are a lot of things I would have done differently throughout the semester, specifically involving procrastination and attending class. Many things I would do differently with the Dragon Project, such as adding more functionality or something to spice it up. Even though there are many things I would do differently, I learned a valuable chunk of information pertaining to web design/development.
